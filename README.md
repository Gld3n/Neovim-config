# Neovim-config-files
Neovim configuration file inspired in Nicholas Schurmann's(HolaMundo) and personal research
which supports Golang code and boasts of variadic and useful commands and plugins.

Some plugins used:
* Airline-vim
* NERDTree
* nfs/gocode
* Easymotion
* Fuzzy Finder
* Git-fugitive

And more.

The plugin manager I'm using for this configuration is vim-plug and the theme is Palenight.

Some commands:
-Spacebar as key leader-
* Leader + nt: Toggle NERDTree's file tree.
* Leader + q: Quit Neovim.
* Leader + w: Write file.
* Ctrl + f: Activate Fuzzy Finder.
And some git-fugitive commands as:
* Leader + fgs: Git status.
* Leader + fgc: Git commit.
* Leader + fga: Git add % .
Including also the commands from gocode. You can see them in https://github.com/nsf/gocode.
