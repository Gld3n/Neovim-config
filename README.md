# Neovim-config-files
Neovim configuration file inspired in Nicholas Schurmann's(HolaMundo) and personal research
which supports Golang code and boasts of variadic and useful commands and plugins.

Some plugins used:
* Airline-vim
* NERDTree
* nfs/gocode
* Easymotion
* Fuzzy Finder
* Git-fugitive

And more.

The plugin manager I'm using for this configuration is vim-plug and the theme is Palenight.

* Leader + w: Write file.
* Ctrl + f: Activate Fuzzy Finder.
